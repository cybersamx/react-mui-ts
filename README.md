# react-mui-ts

Starter project with React, Material UI, and Typescript.

## Approach

This project is a template for bootstrapping a React project with the preferred tools and frameworks.

### Frameworks

* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - UI components for Material Design.

### Tools

* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - The default test runner that comes with create-react-app.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Formatting tool.
* [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) - Lint tool for TypeScript.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Yarn as the package manager.
